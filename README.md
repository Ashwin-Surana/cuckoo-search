# CUCKOO SEARCH

Cuckoo Search (CS) is a meta-heuristic algorithm based on the breeding pattern of certain species of cuckoo birds. In our research, we have implemented CS for the NP-hard optimization problem, the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).  We initially followed the implementation given by Lang et al in their paper, “*Discrete Cuckoo Search for the Traveling Salesman Problem.*”  This was able to generate near-optimal solutions within 500 iterations, but not near-optimal solutions for fewer iterations.  The optimal solution was calculated using a Naïve brute force approach which has a complexity of (n!). In this case, we have 11 cities and so, the number of iterations to generate optimal solution by brute force is over 3 crores. In our research, we incorporated local search within the meta-heuristic algorithm and were able to generate near-optimal solutions for as low as 50 iterations.
